    Fixing a website to fit all kinds of devices

HTML 
    Text language
    Describes content - not format
    <meta name helps fit the page to the device
    <title>Display as the name in the browser tab</title>
    Header and section tags are semantic HTML tags
<img src="../" will help find images in directories above the one that you are in (keep adding ../ to find images even further up)
<img src="./" will help find images in your current folder "relative path" - very much recommended

CSS
Class or IDs work similarily but class is for multiple elements so a common style can be applied to multiple elements and IDs would work for unique elements
# will point to the HTML ID
. will point to Class
If you wanted to apply a style to the entire page you can create a class or ID and apply it to the body 
    You can also use * as a universal selector
